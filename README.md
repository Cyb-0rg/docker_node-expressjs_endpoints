## Usage
### Pull the Docker Image
To use this Docker image, you can pull it from Docker Hub using the following command:
<pre>
docker pull ibrahimsadudink/nodejs-endpoints:latest
</pre>

### Run the Docker Container
After pulling the Docker image, you can run a container using the following command:
<pre>
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d ibrahimsadudink/nodejs-endpoints:latest
</pre>
This will start the Node.js application inside the container and map the container's port 3000 to the host's port 3000. You can customize the port mapping as needed.

### Access the Endpoints
Once the container is running, you can access the endpoints by sending HTTP requests to http://localhost:3000 (assuming you're running the container on your local machine and mapped the ports as shown in the previous command). The endpoints are configured to handle various types of HTTP request methods, such as:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server
- **POST**: Submit data to the server
- **PUT**: Update data on the server
- **DELETE**: Remove data from the server
- **PATCH**: Partially updates data on the server
- **OPTIONS**: Implementation for OPTIONS method
- **HEAD**:  Implementation for HEAD method
- **CONNECT**: Implementation for CONNECT method
- **TRACE**:  Implementation for TRACE method

You can customize the endpoints in the Node.js application code to implement the desired functionality for your application.

### Customization
To customize the Node.js application and the endpoints, you can follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository of the Node.js application:

 <pre>
git clone https://github.com/Cyb-0rg/docker_node-expressjs_endpoints.git
 </pre>
Navigate to the cloned directory:

<pre>
cd  docker_node-expressjs_endpoints
 </pre>
Open the app.js file or the main file of your Node.js application using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

Customize the Express.js endpoints to implement the desired functionality for your application. You can add, modify, or remove endpoints as needed, and implement the appropriate logic to handle the different types of HTTP request methods.

Build a Docker image from the customized Node.js application:

docker build -t your-image-name .
Push the Docker image to a container registry like Docker Hub:
 <pre>
docker push your-image-name
 </pre>
Update the Docker Hub readme and provide instructions for how to use the customized Docker image, including pulling the image, running a container, and accessing the endpoints.
